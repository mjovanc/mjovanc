### Qryptic

🔭 As a side hobby I'm working on Qryptic. Qryptic is a project I've been working on for a while now. The project is about providing a good open REST API of available crypto currencies, wallets and exchanges. It will probably include a lot more in the future. I'm personally focusing mostly on the Qryptic API which is built with Spring and the CI/CD environment to be able to build the software and setup the infrastructure needed for deploying it. And [@DennisDemir24](https://github.com/DennisDemir24) is focusing on building the frontend.

🌱 If you are interested in contributing as well as learning more about either with backend development of Spring or frontend with React you are welcome to send me a email or join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/xrtwNfqshz
