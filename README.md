### Kryptokrona

üî≠ I also work on Kryptokrona. Kryptokrona is a decentralized blockchain from the Nordic based on CryptoNote, which forms the basis for Monero, among others. CryptoNote is a so-called ‚Äúapplication layer‚Äù protocol further developed by TurtleCoin that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

Currently my main focus is developing the [Kryptokrona](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona) core Blockchain. Also developing the [Kryptokrona Java SDK](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-sdk) to be able to integrate in systems using Java. I also doing development of the  as well as developing [Hugin Cache](https://github.com/kryptokrona/hugin-cache). The project enables you to save old messages on the boards and to provide RESTful API endpoints to get this data easily. The project benefits all the community members as well as the Kryptokrona project itself.
