### Qryptic

🔭 As a side hobby I'm working on Qryptic. Qryptic is a project I've been working on for a while now. The project is about providing a good open REST API of crypto currencies,
crypto wallets and crypto exchanges. It will probably include a lot more in the future. I'm personally focusing mostly on the Qryptic API which is built with Spring Boot and
the CI/CD environment to be able to setup the infrastructure needed. 

🌱 If you are interested in contributing as well as learning more about either with backend development of Spring Boot or frontend with React you are very welcome
to submit pull requests.
