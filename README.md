### Hi, I'm Marcus!

I work on Kryptokrona. Kryptokrona is a decentralized blockchain from the Nordic based on CryptoNote, which forms the basis for Monero, among others. CryptoNote is a so-called “application layer” protocol further developed by TurtleCoin that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

Currently my main focus is developing the [Kryptokrona](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona) core Blockchain, [Hugin CLI](https://github.com/kryptokrona/hugin-cli), [Hugin API](https://github.com/kryptokrona/hugin-api).

File issues and pull-requests in any and all of the projects I participate in. Contact me via
email at `mjovanc@icloud.com` on Twitter at [@mjovanc](https://twitter.com/mjovanc/) or on Hugin in the
`#projectdevelopment` board or directly on [Hugin](https://hugin.chat) using the Hugin key: `SEKReYnVqraauaL1oPN6c48TaHyC7d8ZgYne1TK8oNCABZYWEhnSh8h6bZgazmoDyLP2CYnxkX2XrAkrB5i5t2PpgTaVDbDgmNg415b49a4af9ba520819d45eed41b897b97f03ddb107757a570e014342e7c6b34`.

I also run a blog on Medium which I go through different technologies: [https://mjovanc.com](https://mjovanc.com).
