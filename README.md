### Kryptokrona

üî≠ I also work on Kryptokrona. Kryptokrona is a decentralized blockchain from the Nordic based on CryptoNote, which forms the basis for Monero, among others. CryptoNote is a so-called ‚Äúapplication layer‚Äù protocol further developed by TurtleCoin that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

Currently my main focus is developing the [Kryptokrona](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona) core Blockchain. I also doing development of [Hugin Cache](https://github.com/kryptokrona/hugin-cache). The project enables you to save old messages on the boards and to provide RESTful API endpoints to get this data easily. I also develop on the [Kryptokrona Java SDK](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-sdk) and on the new Hugin Messenger desktop application [Hugin Svelte](https://github.com/kryptokrona/hugin-svelte).
